One method that I discovered works well for building tech products in age of AI is using PRD / LLD method   

1. So this starts with laying out what you want to build   

2. Then start preparing data models and api contracts for how that would work (best if you can find some open source widely used method for the same)

3. Then invest your time in solidifying / seeing how that would work for your existing system

4. Once that is optimized, then send to ai agent to complete this 

This is not just spec based development it goes much deeper that this .. 
(spec based ends at level 1 with some questions asked, too shallow)
