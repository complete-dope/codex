This is a test post to demonstrate the features of the PaperMod theme and establish a consistent format for future posts.

## Table of Contents

As you can see, the table of contents is automatically generated and displayed at the beginning of the post because `ShowToc` is set to `true` in the front matter.

## Markdown Elements

Here are some examples of standard Markdown elements.

### Text Formatting

You can use **bold**, *italic*, and `code` formatting.

### Lists

- Unordered List Item 1
- Unordered List Item 2
  - Nested Item

1. Ordered List Item 1
2. Ordered List Item 2

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's useful for highlighting important information or quoting someone.

### Code Blocks

The theme has syntax highlighting for code blocks, and you can enable a "copy" button.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Hugo!")

hello_world()
```

## Shortcodes

Hugo's shortcodes are also supported. For example, you can use the `figure` shortcode to add images with captions.

{{< figure src="/posts/2017-06-21-overview/ANN.png" title="An example image from another post" >}}

This format should provide a great starting point for your future blog posts.
