# Python oops
Oops is not that simple as we use in projects , its an interesting low-level discussion 

`class` variables :
So these are the one that are same for all the instance of the class and are from same memory location so changing any one of these will lead to change of other as well.

`instance` variables : 
So these are defined instance wise, and are localised to each instance and each instance has its own memory space for this 


# Design patterns 



## Decorators
<details>
  <summary>Python inbuilt decorators</summary>
  1. staticmethod : methods that doesnt access instance (self) or class data (cls) 
  2. classmethod : method that takes class 'cls' as first argument 
  3. functools : these are tools defined over class methods
