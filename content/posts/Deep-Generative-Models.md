complex probability that we cant define using stats we use ML in that to help us with it ( learning from data ) 

## Diffusion LLMs

**Curriculum learning** : teach model easy parts in the beginning tough parts at later stages of training. 

**Knowledge Distillation** : We need to use knowledge distillation over steps lets says if we are running diffusion for 1000 steps then we can learn to skip every one step in between to get a better distilled model and this process we can repeat
